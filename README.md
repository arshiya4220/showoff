 # ShowOff

Welcome to ShowOff, it aims to provide a platform for users to share their experiences, stories, and moments with others. It's built with Firebase for the backend and sanity.io for the database, while the frontend is powered by React and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview
In this project, I have developed a social media application where users can create and share posts, connect with others, and explore content shared by the community.
